    <p class="para">Venus is often called Earth's "sister planet" because of their similar size and composition. 
       However, Venus has a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with clouds of sulfuric acid, 
       creating a runaway greenhouse effect. This makes it the hottest planet in the solar system, 
       with surface temperatures averaging 465°C (900°F)—hot enough to melt lead. Venus rotates 
       in the opposite direction of most planets, meaning the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east.</p>
    <p class="para">The pressure on Venus' surface is about 92 times that of Earth, equivalent to being 900 meters (3,000 feet) 
       underwater. Due to its thick clouds, Venus appears bright in the night sky and is often called 
       the "Evening Star." Several probes, including the Soviet Venera missions and NASA’s Magellan, 
       have mapped its surface using radar.</p>
