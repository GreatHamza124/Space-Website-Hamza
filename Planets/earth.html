    <p class="para">Earth is the only planet known to support life, thanks to its atmosphere, liquid water, and moderate climate. 
       It has a 71% water-covered surface, with a protective magnetic field and ozone layer that shield life from 
       harmful solar radiation. Earth’s atmosphere is composed mainly of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and trace gases.</p>
    <p class="para">The planet has one natural satellite, the Moon, which stabilizes Earth's axial tilt and influences tides. 
       Earth’s rotation takes 24 hours, and it orbits the Sun every 365.25 days, leading to the leap year system. 
       The presence of diverse ecosystems, ranging from deserts to rainforests, allows millions of species to thrive.</p>
