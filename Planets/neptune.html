    <p class="para">Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun and the coldest in the solar system, with temperatures dropping 
       as low as -214°C (-353°F). It is the windiest planet, with storm speeds reaching up to 2,100 km/h (1,300 mph), 
       faster than the speed of sound on Earth. The planet appears deep blue due to methane in its atmosphere, 
       which absorbs red light and scatters blue light.</p>
    <p class="para">Neptune has 14 known moons, the largest being Triton, which orbits in the opposite direction of the planet's 
       rotation—a sign it was likely captured from the Kuiper Belt. A day on Neptune lasts 16.1 hours, while a year 
       takes 165 Earth years. It was discovered in 1846 and remains the only planet found through mathematical 
       predictions before being observed. NASA’s Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft to have visited Neptune, flying by in 1989.</p>
