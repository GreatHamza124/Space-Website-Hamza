    <p class="para">Uranus is unique because it rotates on its side, likely due to a massive collision in its past. Its axial tilt of 
       98 degrees causes extreme seasonal variations, with each pole experiencing 42 years of sunlight followed by 42 
       years of darkness. It is an ice giant, composed mostly of water, ammonia, and methane, which gives it a pale blue 
       color.</p>
    <p class="para">A year on Uranus lasts 84 Earth years, and a day is 17.2 hours long. The planet has 13 faint rings and at least 
       27 known moons, named after characters from Shakespeare and Alexander Pope’s works. Uranus was discovered by 
       William Herschel in 1781 and has only been visited once, by Voyager 2 in 1986.</p>
