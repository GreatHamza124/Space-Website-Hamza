    <p class="para">Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and
        the closest to the Sun. It has no atmosphere, meaning
        it experiences extreme temperature variations, ranging
        from 430°C (800°F) during the day to -180°C (-290°F) 
        at night. A year on Mercury (one orbit around the Sun) 
        takes just 88 Earth days, but due to its slow rotation, 
        one full day-night cycle lasts 176 Earth days. The 
        planet's surface is covered in craters from asteroid 
        impacts, similar to Earth's Moon.</p>
    <p class="para">Despite being the closest planet to the Sun, Mercury 
       is not the hottest. It has a weak magnetic field, 
       about 1% the strength of Earth’s, and its thin 
       exosphere consists mostly of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen,
       helium, and potassium. Spacecraft such as NASA’s 
       MESSENGER and Mariner 10 have provided detailed 
       images of Mercury’s surface.</p>
