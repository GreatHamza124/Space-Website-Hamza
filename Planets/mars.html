    <p class="para">Mars, known as the "Red Planet," gets its color from iron oxide (rust) on its surface. It has the largest volcano 
       in the solar system, Olympus Mons, which is nearly three times the height of Mount Everest. Mars also has 
       Valles Marineris, a canyon system that dwarfs Earth's Grand Canyon. The planet’s thin atmosphere, composed 
       mostly of carbon dioxide (95%), cannot support liquid water on the surface, but evidence suggests that 
       water once flowed there.</p>
    <p class="para">A Martian day, called a sol, lasts 24.6 hours, and a year is 687 Earth days long. The planet has two small moons, 
       Phobos and Deimos, which are likely captured asteroids. NASA’s Curiosity, Perseverance, and other rovers continue 
       to explore Mars, searching for signs of past life and preparing for future human missions.</p>
