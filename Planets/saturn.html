    <p class="para">Saturn is best known for its stunning ring system, made mostly of ice and rock particles. It is the second-largest 
       planet, with a diameter of 120,536 km (74,898 miles). Like Jupiter, Saturn is a gas giant, composed mainly of 
       hydrogen and helium. It has at least 146 moons, with Titan being the largest and the only moon in the solar system 
       with a thick atmosphere.</p>
    <p class="para">Saturn has a very low density; if a large enough ocean existed, Saturn would float on water. A day on Saturn lasts 
       10.7 hours, and its year is 29.5 Earth years long. NASA’s Cassini spacecraft studied Saturn for over a decade, 
       revealing details about its rings, storms, and moons.</p>
