    <p class="para">Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system, with a diameter of 139,820 km (86,881 miles). It is a gas giant, 
       composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, with no solid surface. The planet’s famous Great Red Spot is a storm 
       larger than Earth that has raged for centuries. Jupiter has at least 95 known moons, the largest being Ganymede, 
       which is even bigger than Mercury.</p>
    <p class="para">A day on Jupiter lasts only 9.9 hours, making it the fastest spinning planet in the solar system. Jupiter generates 
       the strongest magnetic field of any planet, creating intense radiation belts. Its four largest moons—Io, Europa, 
       Ganymede, and Callisto—were first discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610.</p>
